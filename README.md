## Assignment
Using flask and flask SQLAlchemy, we were instructed to complete a simple project to help grasp the concepts of using an ORM to manipulate a database and use that data in your application.

## To Do
I have completed "part one" but I still have to complete the other sections. I need to write tests for the application and add some simple styling.
