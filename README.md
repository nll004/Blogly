## Assignment
Using flask and flask SQLAlchemy, we were instructed to complete a simple project to help grasp the concepts of using an ORM to manipulate a database and use that data in your application. I created a simple app to create users with edit and delete options. I made simple posts with a title and content to attribute to users and store in the database. The posts are modifyable and deleteable. 

## To Do
I have completed part 1 and 2, but I still have to complete part 3. I need to write tests for the application and add some simple styling.
